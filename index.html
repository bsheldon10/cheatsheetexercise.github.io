    "font-weight" = setting a section of text to be bold or normal. You can use numbers 0-1000 to define this as well, but use iterations of 100 where 400 is equal to normal, and 700 is equal to bold <hr>

    "text-align" = where would you like your text to sit within the page? left, right, centred, or justified? <hr>

    "font-style" = for changing the style from normal to italic or oblique. <hr>

    "@font-face" = you use this when you are looking to link an uploaded font file to your website in the CSS file. Use this at the top of your document, then set the 'font-family' name as well. This is an internal URL option.
